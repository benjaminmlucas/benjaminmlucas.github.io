Thanks for dropping by! I'm Ben, an Assistant Professor of Data Science in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Northern Arizona University. Here you'll find some info about me, my research interests, published articles, and my academic CV.

About Me
======
I have a PhD in spatiotemporal machine learning from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. I generally enjoy all-things data science and machine learning - algorithms, programming, supervised/unsupervised/semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, reinforcement learning, issues with dimensionality, optimization, computer vision, and the mathematics of machine learning/data science. My academic work has found applications in: health and epidemiology; remote sensing and environmental science; and, the social sciences.
